## Key Features 

CustosPass aims to be a user-friendly password manager that does not save or communicate any data to a remote server, maximizing user privacy. All the information stored inside the CustosPass vault is securely stored locally and can only be shared in a peer-to-peer fashionoâ€”only the user decides when their data leaves their device! 

Backups can be created at any time and stored wherever the user wishes; no server is involved. 

### Supported Platforms

- Linux
- Windows 
- Android 

Support for any other platform is not planned, at the moment.

## Disclaimer

This project is designed and maintained by a postgraduate student in cybersecurity (me :)) who wants to explore the password managers space and apply his knowledge through practical development.

Feedback, ideas, and advice from the community are highly welcome. There is always room for improvement!
